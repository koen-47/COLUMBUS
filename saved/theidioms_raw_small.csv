burn bridges
bear the brunt of
bread and butter
think outside the box
make no bones about
a bolt from the blue
be in the same boat
blow hot and cold
once in a blue moon
new blood
blood on hands
new kid on the block
a blessing in disguise
blaze a trail
draw a blank
in black and white
black sheep
bite tongue
bite off more than can chew
bite the hand that feed
bite the dust
big deal
bits and pieces
